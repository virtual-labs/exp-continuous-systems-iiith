Start the experiment with default values of buildings' height and ground motion(amount of vibration). Pause the experiment after a few cycles and observe the response of all the different structures for the same parameters.

**Observation 1:**

Vary the height of the buildings and note the corresponding variations in their responses.

**Observation 2:**

Vary the ground motion parameter and note the corresponding variations in all the buildings' responses for the different values.
